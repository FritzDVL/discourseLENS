12. ✅ `lib/stylesheet/` - Theme compilation system

### File Pattern Deletions:
- ✅ All `*theme*` files in JavaScript directories
- ✅ All `*.test.mjs` files (JavaScript tests)
- ✅ All `*_spec.rb` files (Ruby specs)
- ✅ All `*_test.rb` files (Ruby tests)

### Model Deletions:

- ✅ `color_scheme*.rb` - Color scheme models
- ✅ `screened_*.rb` - Screening system models
- ✅ `reviewable*.rb` - Review system models

- ✅ `embeddable_host.rb` - Embedding system model

### Controller Deletions:
- ✅ `theme_javascripts_controller.rb`
- ✅ `stylesheets_controller.rb`
- ✅ `svg_sprite_controller.rb`
- ✅ `qunit_controller.rb`

## What Remains (Core Architecture):

### Backend (Ruby/Rails):
- ✅ Core controllers (topics, posts, users, categories, etc.)
- ✅ Core models (User, Topic, Post, Category, etc.)
- ✅ Email system (mailers) - KEPT as requested
- ✅ User features (badges, profiles) - KEPT as requested
- ✅ Backup system - KEPT as requested
- ✅ Essential services and jobs
- ✅ Core view templates

### Frontend (Ember.js):
- ✅ Core Discourse app (`app/assets/javascripts/discourse/app/`)
- ✅ Essential components (topic-list, post, composer, etc.)
- ✅ Core routing and controllers
- ✅ Essential services
- ✅ Core stylesheets
- ✅ UI libraries (float-kit, select-kit, etc.)

### Infrastructure:
- ✅ Database migrations (`db/migrate/`)
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Core library files (`lib/`)
- ✅ Public assets

## Estimated Impact:
- **Frontend Reduction:** ~70-80%
- **Backend Reduction:** ~50-60%
- **Overall Codebase:** ~60-70% smaller
- **Plugins Removed:** 100% (polls, reactions, math, local-dates, etc.)
- **Admin Interface:** 95% removed
- **Theme System:** 100% removed
- **Testing Infrastructure:** 95% removed

## Result:
A **minimal, clean Discourse architecture** focused on core discussion functionality while maintaining:
- Modern UI/UX
- User management and advanced features
- Email notifications and system
- Backup/restore capabilities
- Clean, translatable codebase structure

Perfect for understanding core architecture or translating to a different framework!
